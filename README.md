# A Little about me

Currently a curious and motivated student that is looking forward for internship opportunities.

I am a Junior studying GIS: Data Science and Informatics. I believe that understanding the human interaction between technology is extremely important in creating impacts. Through these technical skills, I hope to be able to provide the right needs for the right group of people - whether that be the disenfranchised or disadvantaged, and many more.

> respect, understand, appreciate, enjoy, and grow!
