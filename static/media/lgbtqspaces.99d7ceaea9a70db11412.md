Shifting LGBTQ+ Spaces is an effort by a team of faculty and students at the University of Washington to build and eventually analyze a nationwide data base of LGBTQ+ spaces and places in the U.S.from the mid-1960s through the mid-2010s. The data base is meant to be expandable to the present but for the moment is focused on the time period indicated. Our project is funded by the National Science Foundation (Grant #1951072) with support from the UW Center for Studies in Demography & Ecology, the UW Department of Geography, the UW Humanistic GIS Laboratory, and the University of Washington Tacoma.    

### My Contributions:    
I was onboarded onto the project in the early phases of the the project and started out with building the prototype platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I participated and gave input to the data-entry team, the growth of the amount of data transcribed from the Travel Guides to digital form, the platform was expanded to a full-stack web application. The decision to use PostGreSQL mainly lied within the presence of coordinate data. Furthermore, a complete ERD database structure was developed to ensure data normalization. I also developed multiple different routes for RESTFUL APIs and ensured that it was secure. Later phases of the project, I was actively involved in the betterment of the user experience and feature changes/refinements.    

### What I learned:    
     - Full-Stack Development 
     - Database Development and Data Modeling   
     - Customer-centered details and development approaches     


### Further reflections:    
The project started out with just a simple csv file and data visualization task and expanded into a bigger full-stack application with multiple different features. What I wish that I could of done better as one of the major code contributors was probably to use a framework to use (like React or Vue.js). The entire frontend of this web application was down through Vanilla Javascript. Although this proved to be a good practice, it proved to be more complicated in managing features and reading past code. I would also like to emphasize more on code documentation better. Scrolling through hundreds of lines of code was challenging and was sometimes frustrating.
