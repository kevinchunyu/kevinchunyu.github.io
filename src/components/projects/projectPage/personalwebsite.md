Built with: JavaScript, CSS, React.js, MongoDB   
Tools used: VSCode, GitHub, MongoDB, Amazon S3    

A personal website to display my projects and hopefully interesting notes in the future. I also wanted to use this opportunities to explore front-end development using React.js.      

The website is hosted on Netlify, both frontend, and backend. The backend utilizes a MongoDB to store just the markdown documents for the projects page, as well as the resume and all photos. All these photos are stored on an Amazon S3 bucket.      


***Personal Development Notes:***   
    - MongoDB is pretty flexible - the document-based data is really growing on me, as I can freely add and change how I want my data to look like when I am developing.    

    - I wonder if using an API to send my projects and having a little backend "upload" site for my projects is over-engineering, but on the bright side - for any new project I now have, I can just type what I need and upload.    

    - Needed some time to get use to thinking the "React" way -- passing down data through parameters was a little challenging..    

    - Add search bar when projects start to pile up, with filters by category?    

    - First time storing things on Amazon S3 - the permissions and customisability is pretty nice-- definitely not hard to use too!    

    - Automate the full process with a proper CI/CD? All I need to do is to upload the new .md file into my bucket on Amazon S3 and my website will render the right things?     

    - Maybe I can add more random stuff/notes onto my personal website
