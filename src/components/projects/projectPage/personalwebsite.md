Built with: JavaScript, CSS, React.js, MongoDB   
Tools used: VSCode, GitHub, MongoDB, Amazon S3

A personal website to display my projects and passion for technology. I also wanted to use this opportunities to explore some front-end development using React.js. 

Random Development Notes:   
    - MongoDB is pretty flexible - the document-based data is really growing on me, as I can freely add and change how I want my data to look like when I am developing.    
    - I wonder if using an API to send my projects and having a little backend "upload" site for my projects is over-engineering, but on the bright side - for any new project I now have, I can just type what I need and upload.    
    - Needs some time to get use to thinking the "React" way -- passing down data through parameters was a little trippy..    
    - Add search bar?    
    - First time storing things on Amazon S3 - the permissions and customisability is pretty nice-- definitely not hard to use too..    
    - Automate full process? All I need to do is to upload the new .md file into my bucket on Amazon S3 and my website will render the right things?     
    - maybe I can add more random stuff/notes on my personal website
